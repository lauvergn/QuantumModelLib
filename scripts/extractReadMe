* Originally, it has been developed during the Quantum-Dynamics E-CAM project :
     https://www.e-cam2020.eu/quantum-dynamics
=========================================
 1) Installation
   From the QuantumModelLib directory, when make is executated, 
   the "libQMLibFull_XXX_optx_ompy_lapakz.a" must be created (ex: libQMLibFull_gfortran_opt1_omp1_lapack1).
   XXX is the compiler name and x,y and z are 0/1 when flags are turn off/on. 
   They correspond to OPT (compiler optimzation), OpenMP and Lapack/blas, respectively.

   This version works with:
       gfortran 9.0 (linux and macOS)
       ifort    19

 2) Link the library to your code

When lapack/blas are not linked to the library:

   gfortran ....   $QuantumModelLib_path/libQMLibFull_XXX_optx_ompy_lapak0.a

or with  lapack/blas (linux)

   gfortran ....   $QuantumModelLib_path/libQMLibFull_XXX_optx_ompy_lapak0.a -llapack -lblas

      QuantumModelLib_path contains the path of the QuantumModelLib


 3) In your Fortan code

 In the following, it shows how to initialize, compute with the driver subroutines (the full library is needed, the Fortran module files are not required)

 3a1) Initialization of the model (the Potential)

        CALL sub_Init_Qmodel(ndim,nsurf,pot_name,adiabatic,option)

        where
           ndim       : the number of degree(s) of freedom [integer]
           nsurf      : the number of electronic surface(s) (adiabatic or diabatic) [integer]
           pot_name   : the name of the potential or model (phenol, Tully, HenonHeiles ...) [string of characters]
           adiabatic  : flag (.TRUE. or .FALSE.) [logical]
           option     : option, to be able to select a model with several options (Tully ...) [integer]

     The list of available models is given below

     Example:
        ndim  = 2
        nsurf = 3
        CALL sub_Init_Qmodel(ndim,nsurf,'phenol',.FALSE.,0)

        It initializes the phenol potential (2D and 3 PES).
        => Computation of the diabatic surface


 3a2) Initialization of the potential (reading the model)

 CALL sub_Read_Qmodel(ndim,nsurf,nio)

 where
    ndim       : the number of degree(s) of freedom [integer]
    nsurf      : the number of electronic surface(s) (adiabatic or diabatic) [integer]
    nio        : file unit where the namelist is read. It can be the standard unit [integer]

  Then, the &potential namelist is read.
  In the following exemple, the 2+1D-retinal model ('Retinal_JPCB2000') is read.

  &potential
    pot_name='Retinal_JPCB2000' ! potential surface name
    ndim=3 PubliUnit=f
    adiabatic=t
    Phase_checking=f
     /

     It initializes the 2+1D-retinal model (ndim=3).
     For this model, fhe number of electronic surfaces is automatically set up to 2.
     => adiabatic=t      : Computation of the adiabatic surface: 
     => Phase_checking=f : The adiabatic vector phases are not checked between several calculations
     => PubliUnit=f      : The atomic units are used

 3a3) Initialization (extra)
    Some extra parameters can be initialized with specific procedures:

    - Phase_Following (default: .TRUE. ) for the adiabatic calculations:
              CALL set_Qmodel_Phase_Following(Phase_Following)

    - Phase_Checking (default: .TRUE. ) for the adiabatic calculations:
              CALL set_Qmodel_Phase_Checking(Phase_Checking)

    - ...

    or it can be set up while reading the model (see 3a2).

 3b) Potential energy surface(s), PES, evaluation

        CALL sub_Qmodel_V(V,Q)

        where
           Q(:)   is the ndim coordinates (vector of real(kind=8))
           V(:,:) is PES and a  nsurf x nsurf matrix of real (kind=8)

     Remarks:
      - when adiabatic is set to .TRUE., V(:,:) is a diagonal matrix.
      - Use sub_Qmodel_VG(V,G,Q) to get the potential and the gradient
            G(:,:,:) are real (kind=8) of nsurf x nsurf x ndim
      - Use sub_Qmodel_VGH(V,G,H,Q) to get the potential, the gradient and the hessian
            H(:,:,:,:) are real (kind=8) of nsurf x nsurf x ndim x ndim
      - Use sub_Qmodel_VG_NAC(V,G,NAC,Q) to get the potential, the gradient and the
            non-adiabatic couplings (NAC).
            NAC(:,:,:) are real (kind=8) of nsurf x nsurf x ndim

 3c) Potential energy surface with vibrational adiabatic separation
    This feature can be used only when the "model" is read.
    Therefore in the initialization with sub_Init_Qmodel "pot_name" must be "read_model".
    Then:

    (i) The potential must be read as a namelist:

      &potential
          pot_name='hbond' ! potential surface name
          Vib_adia=t
          list_act=1
          read_nml=f
          nb_channels=6
      /

    In this example the 'Hbond' potential is used within the adiabatic separation (Vib_adia=t).
    Read_nml=f, the specific namelist for 'hbond' model is not read.
    The number of channels (nsurf) is 6
    list_act is a table which enables to select the active coordinate(s) (here the first one only)
    The inactive coordinates are just the remaining coordinates (here 2)

    (ii) A basis set must be read for the inactive coordinates:

    &basis_nD name='boxAB' nb=64 nq=64 A=-2.5 B=2.5 /

    Here, it is a 1D basis set (particle-in-a-box), with
      64 basis function (nb)
      64 grid points (nq)
      The range of the coordinate is [A,B]

    WARNING: It is working only with ONE inactive variable.

    The following subroutine enables to get the effective Hamiltonian along Qact(:).
      CALL sub_Qmodel_tab_HMatVibAdia(tab_MatH,Q,nb_terms)
    The table tab_MatH(nsurf,nsurf,nb_terms) contains:
      - Heff: tab_MatH(nsurf,nsurf,1)                 [1 matrix]
      - F2 terms: tab_MatH(nsurf,nsurf,2:...)         [ (nb_act+1)nb_act/2 matrices)]
      - F1 terms: tab_MatH(nsurf,nsurf,...:nb_terms)  [ nb_act matrices ]

 3d) Get the metric tensor, GGdef

        CALL get_Qmodel_GGdef(GGdef)

        where
           GGdef(:,)  is the ndim x ndim matrix of real (kind=8)

     Most of the models are associated with a specific kinetic energy operator (KEO)
     Here, it is given through a constant metric tensor, GGdef, so the that the KEO is:

        T = -1/2 Sum_ij d./dQi GGdef(i,j) d./dQj

     Its diagonal components, GGdef(i,i), can be view as the invers of masses (1/Mi)

     The volume element, dTau, is:

        dTau = dQ1.dQ2 ... dQndim

     Remark: The metric tensor can be modified:
        CALL set_Qmodel_GGdef(GGdef,ndim)

        where
           ndim       is the number of degree(s) of freedom it MUST be indentical to the initialized value (with sub_Init_Qmodel)
           GGdef(:,)  is the new metric tensor a ndim x ndim matrix of real (kind=8)

 5) Examples and Tests

 With "make all", the libraries are created and several main programs.

 5a) To test the implementation
 From the main QuantumModelLib directory:

    make ut

 From the Tests directory

    ./run_test_QML

  => Some options are possible, the compiler, OPT, OMP, Lapack

  Or you can run:
    ./run_tests

  => All possible combinations between OPT=0/1, OMP=0/1, Lapack=0/1 will be tested. Beware, this test is long.

 5b) To run examples
From the main QuantumModelLib directory:

  ./TEST_driver.x < Tests/DAT_files/Vibadia_HBond.dat > res_driver
=> Test sevral models (1 or several surfaces, optimization, Vibration adiabatic separation)

  ./TEST_VibAdia.x < Tests/DAT_files/Vibadia_HBond.dat > res_VibAdia
=> Test a Vibration adiabatic separation model.

  ./TEST_grid.x > res_grid
=> Test the 1D and 2D-cut generation for HenonHeiles potential (it uses subroutines with Fortran modules)

  ./TEST_OMPloop.x > res_loop
=> Test an OpenMP loop (10^5) on the HONO model (several seconds)
